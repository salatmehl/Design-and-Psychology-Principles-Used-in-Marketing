This is a page with a whitepaper aimed to boost your conversion rates through design and psychology.

Hi again!

<b>Why this whitepaper is here?</b></br>
As part of the bootcamp in marketing analytics we had one module on design principles and psychological concepts used in marketing. As an outcome together with 2 colelagues we created a comprehensive document that covers main techniques and provides practical examples you might use in your own marketing strategies. From universal Gestalt principles to conversion-centered design we covered it all so you can understand your customer better.
